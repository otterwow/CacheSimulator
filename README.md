# CacheSimulator
A set associative cache simulator to keep track of cache hits and misses in a three layered architecture with different eviction policies

The two fractals have very different memory access patterns. The Buddhabrot randomly skips over the screen, while the fern has a more deliberate pattern.

Alter the macro #if 0 to 1 in game.cpp to change between the two patterns

Please build the project in 32 bit
